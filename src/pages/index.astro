      Thank you all very much for participating on Qaztup! This is my first
      website ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      With it, I learned a lot about software engineering, and
      bootstrapping a project.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Qaztup was a social network created in the winter of 2015.</p>
    <p>It had multiple domains.</p>
    <p>At its peak, it had 100+ users.</p>
    <p>It never grew beyond that, and it was shut down multiple times.</p>
    <p>The last time it was shut down was in 2018.</p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
      I realised that I love to create things, and I want to create more things.
    </p>
    <p>Some of my current projects are growing, and I'm happy about it.</p>
    <p>You can find me in almost every social network as @marcelo_earth.</p>
